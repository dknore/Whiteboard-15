# Whiteboard-15: Binary Tree Sum

Directions:<br>
Write a function called `treeSum()` that:
- Accepts a binary tree as an argument
- Returns the total value of all the nodes in the tree
- Returns 0 if the tree is empty.

** Assume each node contains a number in its .data property.


Example:<br>
```
Given:
[2, 1, 3, 6, 7]
```
```
Should Return:
19
```
